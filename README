    this readme

Implemented alpha-beta pruning, updated heuristic and minimax. As of 3/13/15, the program works fairly quickly at depth 4, 
 beating ConstantTimePlayer and BetterPlayer. (For some reason, though, the program only works at even depths, 
throwing null move errors at odd depths even though the depth shouldn't affect the moves the program chooses from.)
